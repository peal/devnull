Outcome of the hackathon "Escape from /dev/null"
Where we (peal and JagCesar) coded a lot of HTML5, JavaScript, node.js and Python.


Escape from /dev/null is a programmer competition that is going to blow your mind.

While en route to our mission objective in the Europa System we have come under attack by unknown alien life forms. They are projected to break through our hull within twelve hours. Mission command is trapped on flight deck and has no way of building a strategic defense. Your new mission objective is to team up in rapid response parties and work to liberate us from this threat.
